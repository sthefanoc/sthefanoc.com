# SthefanoC.com - My personal website

A personal website that serves as a playground to experiment with different technologies and also a way to showcase my skills and publicize my services.

## Getting Started

To get this running on another machine, just clone the repo and run the command to start the server. It is important to have node installed:

```
npm start
```

### Prerequisites

Besides [Gatsby JS](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/), that is a great tool for building Static Generated Sites, you will find a lot of other libraries and resources.
Here is a list of some of those:

- disqus-react: for comments
- chart-js: for beautiful dynamic charts
- fontawesome: for styles and fonts
- react-bootstrap: for easy styling
- react-tooltip: for explanations for the user
- gatsby-plugin-google-analytics: for tracking
- gatsby-plugin-google-tagmanager: for tracking even more
- gatsby-plugin-netlify: for making deployment easy

And a lot of others...

### Styles

The website is responsive. Using media-queries the app can be used on desktop or smaller screens.
Bootstrap helped, but most of the styling is on the CSS files.

## Deployment

The app is deployed using [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) for the front-end, [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) as back-end.
The domain is managed on the [Hostinger](https://www.hostinger.com.br/) platform.

## Built With

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - The editor
- [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) - The helper
- [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) - The backend
- [Gatsby JS](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) - The frontend
